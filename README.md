# The Simpsons&trade; Memory Game

This is a card-matching memory game themed around The Simpsons&trade;, a property of The Walt Disney Company.  This game was built as an educational project for General Assembly in 2021.  I chose to create a card-matching memory game to learn more and demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript DOM manipulation and to practice more CSS positioning.  The Simpsons&trade; theme was chosen to have an exciting, vibrant color scheme and familiar imagery to work with.  This show was a favorite of mine throughout my childhood in the '90s.

## Getting Started:

<https://mellow-ball.surge.sh>

<https://dcrhodes.github.io/memory-game/> [*]

Gameplay will be initialized by the player clicking on any card, which will flip to reveal it's face and start the game timer.  The player then clicks additional cards until matching card faces can be found.  When the board is cleared and all cards are match, the game ends, and the total amount of time and card match attempts (moves) will be displayed.  The player can then replay the game to beat their score.

[*] *GitHub Pages does not allow the audio to function properly.  This link has been provided as a strictly visual version to be automatically updated from the GitHUb repository.  The previous Surge link will demonstrate full functionality.*
